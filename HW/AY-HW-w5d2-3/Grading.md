# Instructions

Look for comments with 🍂🍃 in the src folder for the relevant parts to the homework,
e.g. the toPower() for part three of the Arrays homework is under 🍂2.3🍃.

Methods are defined in the separate Java files LoopMap and Arrays. You need to
uncomment the relevant sections in main() and run main()
in order to grade each part of the two homeworks.
