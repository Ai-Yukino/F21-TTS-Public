## Relationship objects

### Overview

A relationship object is an optional top-level member of a resource object which describes relationships between its containing resource and other resources in the API. For example, the [Resource Objects section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects) gives the following example of an article object.

```
// ...
{
  "type": "articles",
  "id": "1",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Rails is Omakase"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "author": {
      "links": {
        "self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
        "related": "/articles/1/author"
      },
      "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
    }
  }
}
// ...
```

Here, the value of `relationships` is an author object representing the author of the given article. You could also imagine storing the "About" page of a blog in the following article object with no relationships entry.

```
{
  "type": "articles",
  "id": "0",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "About"
  }
}
```

### Values

The value of 'relationships' is an object which must contain at least one of the following entries:

- a `links` entry with a [link object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links) (i.e. url data) as in the first example,
- a `data` entry with [resource linkage](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-linkage) (i.e. `type` and `id` entry data via one [resource identifier object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-identifier-objects) or an array of such objects), and
- a `meta` entry with non-standard date via a [meta object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta).

Relationship objects can represent to-one relationships (as in the first example) or to-many relationships, e.g. we could imagine a resource object with `"type": "author"` and a `relationships` object which references all the articles written by this author.

### Namespace

`relationships`, `attributes`, `type`, and `id` share a common namespace. So again considering the first example, we cannot have another relationship entry with key `title` because this would conflict with the `title` key in `attributes`. The `relationships` and `attributes` entries of a resource object are collectively refered to as [fields](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-fields).
